title: New life, new blog
---

I launched [my first blog](http://archives.kevingomez.fr) in 2007, when I
started to attend *lycée* (the American equivalent would be High School I guess,
something like 9th or 10th grade). While most my posts were kinda
*tech-oriented*, the rest of them were... well let's say that I was young and
that I've evolved since!

And here I am, eight years later, about to graduate in computer science and still
posting on this old Wordpress blog. But all the good things eventually come to
an end. My blog and my studies are no exception.

A new chapter starts with change and self-improvement as leitmotiv. I'll move
away from my hometown -- [Clermont-Ferrand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clermont-Ferrand) --
to do my last internship in [Lyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon) and after
that I'll hopefully manage to find a job and live there. This internship -- and
some personal projects I'm working on -- we'll be the occasion for me to
discover new languages, new technologies and meet other developers.

Now looks like the right time to get a fresh start and my blog will be the first
to reflect it.
From now on, I'll try to write as much posts as possible -- in English -- about
what I do at work or for [my open-source projects](https://github.com/K-Phoen).

And that's what this new blog will be all about: computer science, open-source...
in fact, everything I enjoy doing.
All that powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), written in
Markown and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/K-Phoen/k-phoen.github.io)
(and yup, PRs accepted).

Stay tuned guys, it's going to rock.
